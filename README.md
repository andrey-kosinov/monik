# Welcome to MONIK - Simple Site Monitoring Tool!

Our monitoring tool provides easily configurable list of URLs to monitor. Our service will check your URLs every 5 minutes and wait for **200 OK** HTTP Respone code.

If we got any other response code than we immediatly send email to you about this error.

But if we got HTTP 200 OK Responce code our work is not done yet. We check the content of a page and look for key words defined by in URL monitor config.

Thus we can detect errors even if a site doesn't response with a correct HTTP code in case of internal problems.

MONIK is a tottaly free tool. You need just to register and create a list of URLs to monitor.

**Attention!** We require email verification while registration procedure. It is very important for checking deliverability from our service to your email provider.

Thanks and good luck!
